# Jakob Sachs 

Hi and welcome to my personal blog ðŸ‘‹.

Don't expect any frequent posts here, its just an outlet for things i want to get out into the world mostly about computers/programming and simliar things. 
Also, i detest using LLMs for personal-writing so excuse my grammar/spelling.

(_The site is just statically generated with this very neat [zola theme](https://gitlab.com/atgumx/no-style-please) and hosted on a tiny VM._)
